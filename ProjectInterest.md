Project Interest Document 
============

### My background
I am a first year graduate student in the University of Washington’s MS in Information Management program, and I’m working toward a specialization in Information Architecture. My background includes five years of experience in the technology industry. Most recently, I worked for a mobile-based marketing company in Portland, Oregon. Last spring and summer, I volunteered with an organization called Hack Oregon, which promotes open data literacy for civic data on a state/local level. I worked with Hack Oregon take some public-but-barely-useable datasets and helped create user interfaces and websites to make the information more accessible.

### Interest in this position 
I am interested this this position because I'm passionate about open data and would like to help promote it, especially in cases where the data can be used to help people. There's a huge amount of information in this world, and finding the ways to collect, disseminate, and use it is a challenging but rewarding task. I personally would like to gain more experience in this area, and this position will increase my knowledge of the field. This position will also allow me to help others, am I'm excited that the City of Seattle wants to do further work in this area.

### Resources I think will be helpful
  * _Information Architecture for the World Wide Web_, by Peter Morville 
  This book is a general guide to Information Architecture, and it's a great starting point for thinking about broad concepts related to usability. I think this resource will be helpful for considering some of the big-picture ideas. 
  * (http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data)
  This is an example of how the Canadian Government is using and promoting open data. I haven't looked at this resource in great depth, but generally speaking, examining ways in which other governments/organizations approach open data will be useful. 

### Two questions to want to ask my mentor
I'll keep these pretty open-ended. 
  * How do you think open data can help people in this city? What are some examples of uses for this data?
  * What is your vision for how Seattle can be a leader in this area?
