This project is a collaboration between the Open Data Literacy]() program @ the UW iSchool, and the City of Seattle's Open Data program.

In 2017, the Seattle Open Data Program is investing in making improvements to the quality of the datasets being hosted onto [data.seattle.gov](data.seattle.gov). A large element of this work will involve the metadata embedded within our datasets.

As a part of that effort, this project will complete an analysis of what civic data standards could be applied to our new and existing datasets, as well as describe a framework for implementing those standards (to new and existing datasets). The results of this work will be of high value to the program and potentially help the City of Seattle in being able to share data more easily with other regional open data programs.
